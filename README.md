# ðŸ“¸ SnapshotPreviews

An all-in-one iOS snapshot testing solution.

Emerge handles the heavy lifting of generating, diffing and hosting the snapshots for each build, allowing you to focus on building beautiful UI components.

## Features
 - Automatically generate snapshots of SwiftUI previews.
 - Support for color scheme/orientation.
 - Swift package for easy local validation.

## Generating Snapshots

See [the documentation](https://docs.emergetools.com/docs/swiftui-previews) for how to set up snapshot testing for your app.

## Preview Gallery

`PreviewGallery` is an interactive UI built on top of snapshot extraction. It turns your SwiftUI previews into a gallery of compoents and features you can access from your application. Xcode is not required to view the previews. You can use it to preview individual components (buttons/rows/icons/etc)
or even entire interactive features.

The public API of PreviewGallery is just one SwiftUI `View` named `PreviewGallery`. Just display this view to get the full gallery. For example, you could add a button like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PreviewGallery

NavigationLink("Open Gallery") { PreviewGallery() }
```

## Local Debugging

Use this Swift Package for locally debugging your views snapshots. Youâ€™ll need a UI test target that imports the `SnapshottingTests` and `Snapshotting` products from this package. Create a test that inherits from `PreviewTest` like this:

```
import Snapshotting
import SnapshottingTests

class MyPreviewTest: PreviewTest {

  override func getApp() -> XCUIApplication {
    return XCUIApplication()
  }

  override func snapshotPreviews() -> [String]? {
    return nil
  }
}
```

Note there are no test functions. They get automatically added at runtime by `PreviewTest`. You can return a list of previews from the `snapshotPreviews()` function based on what preview you are trying to locally validate. The previews will be added as attachements in Xcodeâ€™s test results. The test must be run on an iOS simulator (not device).
