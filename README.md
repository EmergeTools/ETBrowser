An all-in-one snapshot testing solution built on Xcode previews. Automatic browsable gallery of previews, and no-code snapshot generation with XCTest. Supports SwiftUI and UIKit previews using `PreviewProvider` or `#Preview` and works on all Apple platforms (iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS/visionOS).

- üñºÔ∏è Browse previews on device as part of your app using the `PreviewGallery`, no Xcode required.
- üì∏ Snapshot Xcode previews automatically in a XCTest without writing any test code.
- ‚ôø Run accessibility audits on all your previews in a XCUITest, still without writing any test code.

# Features

## Preview Gallery

`PreviewGallery` is an interactive UI built on top of snapshot extraction. It turns your Xcode previews into a gallery of components and features you can access from your application, for example in an internal settings screen. **Xcode is not required to view the previews.** You can use it to preview individual components (buttons/rows/icons/etc) or even entire interactive features.

</p>

The public API of PreviewGallery is a single SwiftUI `View` named `PreviewGallery`. Displaying this view gives you access to the full gallery. For example, you could add a button to open the gallery like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PreviewGallery

struct InternalSettingsView: View {
  var body: some View {
    NavigationStack {
      Form {
        Section("Previews") {
          NavigationLink("Open Gallery") { PreviewGallery() }
        }
      }
    }
    .navigationTitle("Internal Settings")
  }
}
```

## Local Snapshot Generation

Generate PNGs for each Xcode preview with no code as part of an XCTest. Link your XCTest target to `SnapshottingTests` and create a test that inherits from `SnapshotTest` like this:

```swift
import SnapshottingTests

class DemoAppPreviewTest: SnapshotTest {

  // Return the type names of previews like "MyApp.MyView._Previews" to selectively render only some previews
  override class func snapshotPreviews() -> [String]? {
    return nil
  }

  // Use this to exclude some previews from generating
  override class func excludedSnapshotPreviews() -> [String]? {
    return nil
  }
}
```

Note that there are no test functions; they are automatically added at runtime by `SnapshotTest`. You can return a list of previews from the `snapshotPreviews()` function based on what preview you are trying to locally validate. The snapshots will be added as attachments in Xcode‚Äôs test results.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use Preview macros (`#Preview("Display Name")`) the name of the snapshot uses the file path and the name, for example: "MyModule/MyFile.swift:Display Name"

The [EmergeTools snapshot testing service](https://docs.emergetools.com/docs/snapshot-testing) generates snapshots and diffs them in the cloud to control for sources of flakiness, store images outside of git, and optimize test performance. `SnapshotTest` is for locally debugging these snapshot tests. You can also use `PreviewTest` to get code coverage of all previews in your unit test without generating PNGs. This will validate that previews do not crash (such as a missing @EnvironmentObject) but runs faster because it does not render the views to images.

## Accessibility Audits

Xcode [accessibility audits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuiapplication/4191487-performaccessibilityaudit) can also be run locally on any preview. They are run in a UI test (not unit test). To enable these, inherit from `AccessibilityPreviewTest`. To customize the behavior you can override the following functions in your test:

```swift
import SnapshottingTests
import Snapshotting

class DemoAppAccessibilityPreviewTest: AccessibilityPreviewTest {

  override func auditType() -> XCUIAccessibilityAuditType {
    return .all
  }

  override func handle(issue: XCUIAccessibilityAuditIssue) -> Bool {
    return false
  }
}
```

See the demo app for a full example.

<details>
  <summary>How does it work?</summary>

  The XCTest dynamically inserts test functions by creating functions using the Objective-C runtime and overriding XCTest‚Äôs `testInvocations` function.

  Previews are discovered in the binary by parsing the `__swift5_proto` Mach-O section to see what types conform to `PreviewProvider` (and similar protocols generated by the #Preview macro). Details of how this works in the Swift runtime can be found in our [blog post](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/SwiftProtocolConformance).

# Installation

Add the package dependency to your Xcode project using the URL of this repository (https://github.com/EmergeTools/SnapshotPreviews).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmergeTools/SnapshotPreviews/master/images/image2.png" />
</p>

Link your app to `PreviewGallery` and (optionally) to `SnapshotPreferences` to customize the behavior of snapshot generation.
Link your XCTest target to `SnapshottingTests`.

# Tips

### Unique names

It‚Äôs strongly encouraged to use a display name for every preview, for example:

```swift
struct MyView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  var previews: some View {
    MyView().previewDisplayName("My Display Name")
    // Note if you had more than one view here they should all have different display names.
  }
}

#Preview("My Display Name") {
  MyView()
}
```

The display name will show up in XCTest results and the EmergeTools UI. Display names should be unique within each PreviewProvider or within files in the case of preview macros.

### Environment variables

It‚Äôs recommended to set the environment variable `EMERGE_IS_RUNNING_FOR_SNAPSHOTS` to `1` in your unit test scheme. This is also set when snapshots are generated from the EmergeTools snapshot testing service. Combine it with the Xcode previews variable like this:

```swift
extension ProcessInfo {
  var isRunningPreviews: Bool {
    environment["EMERGE_IS_RUNNING_FOR_SNAPSHOTS"] == "1" || environment["XCODE_RUNNING_FOR_PREVIEWS"] == "1"
  }
}
```

Check `ProcessInfo.isRunningPeviews` to disable behavior you don‚Äôt want in previews such as emitting logging data.

### Variants

> [!TIP]
> Using PreviewVariants greatly simplifies snapshot testing, by ensuring a consistent set of variants and that every view is provided a name.

Using multiple variants of the same view can ensure test coverage of all the ways users interact with your UI. Most are provided by SwiftUI, eg: `.dynamicTypeSize(.xxxLarge)`. There is one built into the package: `.emergeAccessibility(true)`. This function adds a visualization of voice over elements to your snapshot. You can automatically add variants using the [`PreviewVariants` View](https://github.com/EmergeTools/SnapshotPreviews/blob/main/Examples/DemoApp/DemoApp/TestViews/PreviewVariants.swift) that is demonstrated in the example app. It adds RTL, landscape, accessibility, dark mode and large text variants. You can use it like this:

```swift
struct MyView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    PreviewVariants(layout: .sizeThatFits) {
      MyView(mode: .loaded)
        // PreviewVariants requires that every view has a name, so you can‚Äôt create one without a display name
        .previewVariant(named: "My View - Loaded")
      
      MyView(mode: .loading)
        .previewVariant(named: "My View - Loading")
      
      MyView(mode: .error)
        .previewVariant(named: "My View - Error")
    }
  }
}
```
